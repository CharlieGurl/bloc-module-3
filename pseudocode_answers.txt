Checkpoint 2: Intro to Computer Science: 
1.Programmers use pseudocode to break down their steps for creating algorithms.  They aren’t in any particular language, so they are versatile and help to brainstorm ideas. 

2.Pseudocode would not run on the computer, it is almost like comments that describe what we are doing, but with keywords. 

Assignment: 

1.
INPUT first number
INPUT second number
  IF first number is greater than second number THEN
  PRINT first number
ELSE print second number
END IF

2. 
FUNCTION Print1to100()
  FOR each number 1-100
    PRINT number and go to new line;
  END FOR
END FUNCTION

3.
FUNCTION searchForName()
  FOR each contact in phone book
   IF name found in loop is equal to name 
     RETURN text “found name” + the name found
   ELSE name is not found
     RETURN text "no name found"
   END IF
  END FOR
END FUNCTION


4. 

var people = ['Sally Smith', 'Billy Smith', 'Javon James', 'Darius Mitchel'];

function nameSearch(name) {
    for(var i=0; i < people.length; i++) {
        if(people[i] === name) {
            return "Found name " + name;
        }
    }   
}
